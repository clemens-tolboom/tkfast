# TKInter plus FastAPI

This demos running FastAPI within a TKInter application.

After installing the dependencies run `python main.py` then visit http://localhost:8000 and http://localhost:8000/docs

By tweaking arguments or through GUI we can either
- use the GUI as a Client only
- use the server only
- user both GUI and server as a HOST for ie a LAN party
